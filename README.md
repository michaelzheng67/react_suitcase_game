# The Millionaire Suitcase Game is built with React. The purpose of this game is to try and get as close to a million dollars as possible by clicking on whatever suitcase you think has the money.
## If you click on the wrong suitcase, you might lose. Click the secure your winnings button to make sure that you win with the amount of money you collected.

*this was meant to allow me to practice using react and changing states for different components*

### Built with: 
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS 
* React Framework
